# nextgame
I am never sure of what game to try next. So I am going with the most rudimentary solution - Making an application / website where you can enter what games you like or dislike, submit it to a repository and based on existing datasets ( with a simple aggregation based on what other folks who liked and disliked the same games [ or atleast a good % similar ] the site shows you which games you should next.
i suck at programming. please be nice.
